# supernova-animation
animation of betelgeuse supernova-ing - "ported" from old account to new account  
This animation utilises numerous setTimeout()'s and CSS transitions to create a somewhat respectable animation. This method of animation is extremely tedious, and is the reason why better libraries exist for this purpose.
